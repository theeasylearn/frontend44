                        Here's an inspiring story about a poor student who started coding and made it to Google.

                        Arjun grew up in a small village where electricity was unreliable, and internet access was a
                        luxury. His
                        father worked as a daily wage laborer, and his mother stitched clothes to help make ends meet.
                        Despite
                        their struggles, they always encouraged Arjun to study hard.

                        But studying wasn’t easy. Arjun attended a government school where computers were rare. The
                        first time
                        he saw one, he was fascinated by the glowing screen and the endless possibilities it held. He
                        dreamed of
                        becoming a software engineer, but without resources, it felt impossible.

                        ### **The First Step**
                        One day, Arjun’s school organized a computer science workshop. The instructor introduced them to
                        HTML,
                        and Arjun was hooked. He didn't have a laptop, so he borrowed his friend’s phone at night and
                        practiced
                        coding on free online platforms. He read blogs, watched YouTube tutorials, and took free courses
                        whenever he could.

                        His dedication caught the attention of a teacher, who helped him get a used laptop from a local
                        NGO. It
                        was slow, but for Arjun, it was a gateway to the world of coding.

                        ### **The Road to Mastery**
                        Arjun focused on JavaScript because it was beginner-friendly and widely used. He built small
                        projects—web pages, calculators, and even a weather app. He learned about algorithms and data
                        structures, knowing they were key to cracking big tech interviews.

                        To support his family, he took freelance coding jobs, earning small amounts by building websites
                        for
                        local businesses. His nights were spent debugging code while his family slept.

                        ### **The Breakthrough**
                        After months of practice, Arjun came across Google’s coding competition. Though hesitant, he
                        pushed
                        himself to participate. He didn’t win, but he performed well enough to get noticed. A mentor
                        from the
                        competition guided him, helping him refine his coding skills and prepare for interviews.

                        ### **The Google Interview**
                        After multiple applications and rejections, Arjun finally got an interview at Google. He had no
                        formal
                        degree, but his portfolio and competitive programming achievements spoke for him. The interviews
                        were
                        tough, but he stayed calm and tackled each problem with confidence.

                        A few weeks later, the email arrived—**he had an offer from Google!** His years of struggle had
                        paid
                        off.

                        ### **A Message to Dreamers**
                        Today, Arjun works as a software engineer at Google, inspiring thousands of students like him.
                        He often
                        says:
